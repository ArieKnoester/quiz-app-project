# quiz-app-project

Work in progress.

A rework of an older Python course application. Hardcoded True/False 
questions are replaced with an api request to The Open Trivia 
Database (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) so that a new set of 
questions are retrieved every time. A UI will also be added instead
of answering the questions from a terminal.
